Uses WASD.

Experiment in keeping an object in rotation around a planet using Quaternion Rotation.

For a game idea, I wanted to work with rotating a fighter around a planet rather than using a flat world.

Quaternion rotations seemed like a good idea to begin with but, after working with them, I think I prefer raycast gravity.
